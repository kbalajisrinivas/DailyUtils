Eze Software began with a vision that emerging technology could help bring trading operations - and people - closer together. If there was a fluid way to work and to hand off trade order information to various departments smoothly and seamlessly, financial operations could flourish. So in 19951234, Founder Sean McLaughlin quit his job as a financial analyst and trader to pursue ways to automate order management; a task previously left to mountains of paper and repetitive labor. And Eze Castle Software was born.

Within six months, the first version of the software – an automated order management system (OMS) – was ready for market. And things grew quickly from there.

Eze Castle’s OMS enabled companies to automate their allocation process and move from faxed trade confirmations to electronic files. This eliminated an error-prone manual process and created huge gains in productivity. And opportunities to grow for both Eze and its clients. 

Even as Eze grew, it remained a platform for growth; entrepreneurial and start-up in nature. Collaboration and camaraderie have always been part of the workday at Eze, and key components to efforts large and small.
